# About-me
Welcome to my Bioinformatics Portfolio! I would like to present a few of the many bioinformatics codes that I have used in my work. I mainly worked with genomic and transcriptomic data using terminal tools, as well as Python and R. My projects focus on data processing, visualization, and analysis to extract meaningful biological insights. They include NGS data analysis, transcription factor binding site analysis, genome annotation, and various other bioinformatics tasks. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions!
